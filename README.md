How quickly can you identify the US states on the map? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (React, TypeScript)

While the whole world was waiting for the 2020 United States presidential election results, I decided to memorize the 50 US States and and their locations on the map. ðŸ¤“


[react-simple-maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) is a great tool for creating maps.


If the user guesses the location incorrectly 3 times in a row, the correct state will automatically highlight itself. 
How quickly (and with minimum errors) can you identify the US states on the map?

Good Luck! âœˆ
