How quickly can you identify the US states on the map? 😉🗺️ (React, TypeScript)

While the whole world was waiting for the 2020 United States presidential election results, I decided to memorize the 50 US States and and their locations on the map. 🤓

## Live application
[https://tomherman11.github.io/us-states-quiz/](https://tomherman11.github.io/us-states-quiz/) 

If the user guesses the location incorrectly 3 times in a row, the correct state will automatically highlight itself.

Good Luck! ✈

## Development
- The app was created with ```create-react-app --template typescript```.
- [react-simple-maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) is a great tool for creating interactive maps.
