How quickly can you identify the US states on the map? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (React, TypeScript)

While the whole world was waiting for the 2020 United States presidential election, I decided to finally memorize the 50 US States and learn how to identify them on the map ðŸ¤“


[react-simple-maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) is a great tool for consuming different maps.


If the user is mistaken for 3 times consecutively, the state will be revealed and colored.
So, how quickly (and with minimum errors) can you identify the US states on the map?

Good Luck! âœˆ
